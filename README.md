# Bonezegei_I2CScan
### Device Scanner
Bonezegei I2CScan is a repository that provides a simple way to scan and identify I2C devices connected to a microcontroller. It iterates through all possible I2C addresses from 0 to 255 and displays the ones that respond with an acknowledgment. This can be useful for debugging, testing, or discovering new I2C devices. The repository contains the source code, and example code how to use it. Follow the installation steps at https://bonezegei.com on how to install bonezegei libraries on Arduino IDE (Batutay, 2023).
